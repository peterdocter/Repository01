				<h3>Q: Why choose WiFi Master?</h3>
				<p>A: WiFi Master is a necessary tool for android smart phones to search, connect and manage WiFi. It has millions of WiFi information. Users can connect to shared WiFi easily and extend standby hours through smart WiFi management function. The app also supports one-key connection through web authentication which is very convenient and easy to use.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Q: What is auto connect by WiFi Master?</h3>
				<p>If the owner of an encrypted WiFi has shared the WiFi information, users may connect to the WiFi automatically. If the encrypted WiFi information has not been shared, you may share it if you are the owner of the WiFi.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Q: Why I fail to connect to some of the hotspots?</h3>
				<p>A: Please go to the "Connect" tab, tap on "WiFi Key Search" to search for available WiFi hotspots nearby. Those hotspots with Blue keys are shared by our users and can be connected for free.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Q: Why I fail to connect with blue key hotspot?</h3>
				<p>A: The following reasons may contribute to the failure of connection: <br>
(1) The password has been updated by the hotspot owner without sharing <br>
(2) Too many devices are connected concurrently. Please try again later <br>
(3) Weak/unstable signal. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Q: Why I failed to connect to some of the hotspots but others could?</h3>
				<p>A: This may because there are too many devices connected to the hotspots currently. Please search for other blue key hotpots to connect.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Q: Why can't I crack the WiFi password?</h3>
				<p>A: WiFi Master Key is not a cracking tool, and please note that hacking is illegal. We would like to build a sharing community, hence everyone can get connected anywhere, any time.</p>
			</li>
			<li style="border-bottom: none;">
				<h3>Q: Is it a free or paid application?</h3>
				<p>A: Yes, the WiFi Master is totally free of charge at present. We will organize activities periodically so users will get gifts in addition to the free use of the application!</p>
